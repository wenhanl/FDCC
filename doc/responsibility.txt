* Bootstrap Server
** When a new machine wants to act as a Ordinary/Compile Node (CN), it will
   contact the bootstrap server.
** The bootstrap server has information about all the other nodes in the
   system.
** The bootstrap server will respond with this information and the new node can
   start sending heartbeat messages to the other nodes in the system.
** The bootstrap server will also be the one responsible for re-assigning work,
   in case one of the CN fails. When it doesn't see a heartbeat message from a
   CN for a specified of time, it will assign that job to someone else.
** Once all the compile jobs are done (the BS knows it because it is monitoring
   the heartbeats), the BS will assign the linking job to some idle CN.

* Linking Node
** This node is just the one used for linking. It is just another CN, chosen
   to do the linking.

* Ordinary/Compile Node
** These are the worker nodes. They will just listen on a particular socket for
   some sort of work to arrive. Once it's there, they just start executing the
   job.
** They notify what job they have accepted to the other nodes. (They can just
   piggyback this info on the heartbeat messages).
** Once they have finished a particular job, they can notify the others of this
   completion, again via an explicit message or piggybacking on the heartbeat
   message.
